Create simple information systems fastly by using code and feature conventions.

Base is the project that [Castro & Barros](http://castroebarros.net) uses as
base to create information systems for small companies.

## Why

For a long time we have done some Rails projects for a lot of companies and we
have noticed some patterns among these projects, like gems, javascript
libraries, configurations, models, etc.

So we've decided to create a Rails template in order to reduce the time needed
to start new projects. Yes, it worked well some times, but we felt that would
be easier and productive to have a base project that would be cloned, instead
of generate code and copy-and-paste some stuff.

We thought about create some Ruby gems to try make things more reusable, but we
realized that would be still most important to have a good knowledge base.

That way, this project has two goals:
1. serve as a template of project;
2. serve as a place to share and improve conventions.
